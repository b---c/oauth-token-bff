.# Abstract 

This document describes how a JavaScript frontend can delegate access tokens acquisition to a backend component. In so doing, the frontend can access resource servers directly without taking on the burden to communicate with the authorization server, cache tokens and perform operations that are fraught with security challenges when executed in a user agent, but safe and well proven when executed by a confidential client running on a backend.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction {#Introduction}

A large portion of today's development stacks, practices and tools for the web target the user agent itself as execution environment, leveraging local resources to offer a rich, responsive user experience that rivals native applications.
An important aspect of apps running in the user agent is their reliance on API, served from the app's own backend component or from third party providers on disparate domains. Whenever those API are secured according to the (OAuth2 Bearer Token Usage)[@!RFC6750], the user agent app needs to obtain suitable access tokens: however, the task of implementing an OAuth2 [@!RFC6749] client executing in a user agent is complicated by the many security challenges inherent in the browser platform. The original OAuth2 [@!RFC6749] provided guidance dedicated to user agent apps in section 4.2, via the implicit grant. The approach proved to suffer from too many challenges, however, leading subsequent documents (such as the OAuth2 security BCP and OAuth2.1) to recommend a more secure approach based on the authorization code grant with PKCE, and relying on additional security measures such as refresh token rotation and sender constraint. TODO fix the references/language
Even the new guidance doesn't entirely eliminate some of the inherent risks of implementing an OAuth2 client in a user agent. For example, offering an acceptable experience for continuous use of the app typically requires to persist tokens in local storage or to use development patterns that are too complex for the average developer to implement effectively.    
In the attempt to avoid those limitations, developers are increasingly pusuing approaches where their backend components (when available) play a more active role. For example, there are many solutions where the backend takes care of obtaining tokens from the authorization server, using classic confidential client grants, and provides a facade for every API the frontend needs to invoke: in that way, the frontend can simply call the API via facade, securing communications with its backend using mainstream methods such as any cookie based web sign on technology. 
That approach is not always viable, as in the absence of reverse proxy deployments the creation and maintenance of a facade for multiple API can be expensive. As a result, is is increasibly common practice to use a simpler solution: rely on the backend component for obtaining tokens from the authorization server, and sending back to the frontend the resuling access tokens for direct frontend to API communication. As long as the mechanism used for transmitting tokens from the backend to the frontend is secure, the approach is viable: however leaving the details of its implementation to every application and stack developer results in the impossibility to have frontent and backend development stacks to interoperate out of the box. Furthermore, there are a number of security considerations that, if disregarded in the implementation of the pattern, might lead to elevation of privilege attacks and other challenges.  
This documents provides detailed guidance on how to implement the pattern in which a frontend component can delegate token acquisition to its backend component. By offering precise guidance on details such as endpoints and messages format for each operation, this specification will allow developers to create and consume off the shelf components that will easily interoperate and easily mix and match different frontend and backend SDKs, making it possible to author single page apps consuming API on arbitrary domains without suffering any of the security compromises normally associated to a frontent-only approach. 
Given that the pattern described here does not provide any artifact that the frontend can use to obtain session information such as user attributes, something traditional approaches to user agent apps developent do afford, this document also provides a mechanism for the frontend to obtain session information from the backend.

## Topology and Roles

This document describes how a single page application featuring a backend can obtain tokens from an OAuth2 authorization server to access a resource server, while minimizing reliance on browser features known to suffer from security challenges. 
For what the protocol flow is concerned, the topology can be broken down into four roles:

- Frontend  
This represents the application code executing in the user agent, controlling presentation and invoking one or more resource servers. 

- Backend  
The backed represents code executing on a server, in particular on the same domain from where the frontend code has been served. Backedn and frontend are both under the control of the same developer.

- Resource Server  
This represents a classic OAuth2 resource server as described in Section 1.1 of OAuth2 [@!RFC6749], exposing the API the frontent needs to invoke. See {security} for more details applying to notable cases. 

- Authorization Server  
This represents a classic OAuth2 authorization server as described in Section 1.1 of OAuth2 [@!RFC6749], handling authorization for the API the frontent needs to invoke. This document does not introduce any changes in the standard authorization server behavior, however see {security} for some security considerations that might influence the policies of individual servers. 

## Protocol Flow

This section provides a high level description of the way in which the frontend can obtain and use access tokens with the help of its backend.
As a prerequisite for the flow described below, the backend MUST have established a secure session with the user agent, so that all requests from that user agent toward the backend occur over HTTPS and carry a valid session artifact (such as a cookie) that the backend can validate. This document does not mandate any specific mechanism to establish and maintain that session. 

TODO SVG

Figure 1 presents an abstract diagram of the flow followed to obtain an access token and access a protected resource.

(A) The frontent presents to the backend a request for an access token for a given resource server
(B) If the backend does not already have a suitable access token obtained in previous flows and cached, it requests to the authorization server a new access token with the required characteristics, using any artifacts previousy obtained (eg refresh token) and grants that will allow the authorization server to issue the requested token without requiring user interaction.
(C) The authorization server returns the requested token and any additional information according to the grant used (eg validity, actual scopes granted, etc) 
(D) The backend returns the requested access token to the frontend
(E) The frontend presents the access token to the resource server
(F) the resource server validates the incoming token and returns the protected resource  



# Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [@RFC2119] [@RFC8174] 
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Endpoints

This specification introduces .well-known/bff-token and .well-known/bff-sessioninfo, two specialized endpoints the backend exposes to the frontend to support token requests and session information queries.
For the purpose of facilitating the implementation of the pattern with minimal configuration requirements, a default value is defined for both endpoints in form of well known relative paths. The specification also offers the ability to override those defaults, in case of conflicts or other considerations. TODO decide if we need section references.
Both endpoint are meant to be used by the applications' frontend, and the frontend only. As such, the backend MUST verify the the call is occurring in the context of a secure session (eg by mandating the presence of a valid session cookie, received over an HTTPS channel TODO TLS better?) or reject the request TODO reference to the error section.  

## The bff-token Endpoint

The bff-token endpoint is exposed by the backend to allow the frontend to request access tokens. By default, it is exposed on the relative path /well-known/bff-token.
The backend MUST support the use of the HTTP "GET" method for the bff-token endpoint and MAY support the use of the "POST" method as well. Parameters sent without a value MUST be treated as if they were omitted from the request. The backend MUST ignore unrecognized request parameters. See (#requestingAT) for more details on how to use the bff-token endpoint. 

## The bff-sessioninfo Endpoint

The bff-sessioninfo endpoint is exposed by the backend to allow the frontend to obtain information about the current user, so that it can be accessed my the presentation code.  
By default, it is exposed on the relative path /well-known/bff-sessioninfo.
The backend MUST support the use of the HTTP "GET" method for the bff-sessioninfo endpoint. The backend MUST ignore unrecognized request parameters. See (#requestingSessionInfo) for more details on how to use the bff-token endpoint. 

# Requesting Access Tokens to the Backend {#requestingAT}

To obtain an authorization token, the frontend sends a request to the backend via the bff-token endpoint. The flow includes the following steps, as shown in Figure 1 TODO reference
TODO more granular error refs
(1) The frontend generates the request and sends it to the bff-token endpoint as described in (#ATreq) (leg A in figure 1).  
(2) The backend examines the request, validating whether it includes a valid user session: if it doesn't, it rejects the request as described in (#ATErrorInvalidSession). 
(3) The backend extracts user information from the session, using whatever mechanism it deems suitable, and verifies whether it already has in storage a suitable access token satisfying the request (see (#Security) for more details). If it does, it returns it as described in (5).
(4) If there is no suitable access token stored, the backend verifies whether it has the necessary artifacts to request it to the authorization server without requiring user interaction- for example, by using a refresh token previously stored for the current user. If it does, the backed contacts the authorization server with a token request using the grant of choice (leg B of the diagram). In the absence of a suitable artifact required to perform a request toward the authorization server, the backend returns an error to the frontend as described in (#ATErrorNoRT).
(5) If the authorization server returns the requested token as expexcted (leg C in figure 1), the backend returns it to the frontend, as shown in Leg D and described in (#ATresp). If the authorization server denies the request, the backend returns an error to the forntend as described in (#ATErrorFailedGrant).
The following sections provide more details for each of the messages described.

## Access Token Request {#ATreq}

The frontend requests an access token to the backend by specifying the requirements the resulting token must meet. The main parameters are listed below.

* `resource` : The identifier of the desired resource server, as defined in [@RFC8707]. This parameter is OPTIONAL.
* `scope` : The scope of the access request resulting in the desired access token. This parameter follows the syntax described in section 4.1.1 of [@RFC6749]. This parameter is OPTIONAL.

Both parameters MAY be absent from the request. Given that the frontent and the backend are components of the same application, it is possible in some scenarios for the backend to determine what token to return to the frontend without any specific requirement. For example, the application might be consuming only one resource, with a fixed set of scopes: that would make specifying that information in the request from the frontend unnecessary. 

The following is an example of request where both resource and scopes are specified.
```
  GET /.well-known/bff-token?resource=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.example.org%2Fstocks
    &scope=buy HTTP/1.1
  Host: myapp.example.com
```
Note that the request does not need to specify any client attributes, as those are all handled by the backend- and the presence of a pre-existing session provides the context necessary for the backend to select the right settings when crafting requests for the authorization server.

## Access Token Response {#ATresp}

If the backend successfully obtains a suitable token, or has one already cached, it returns it to the frontent in a message featuring the following parameters.

* `access_token` : The requested access token. This parameter is REQUIRED.
* `expires_in` : The lifetime in seconds of the access token, as defined in section 4.2.2 of [@RFC6749]. This parameter is REQUIRED.
* `scope` : The scope of the access token being returned. If the request contained a scope string, and the scope of resulting token is different from the requested value, this parameter is REQUIRED. In all other cases, the presence of scope in the response is OPTIONAL.
The following is an example of access token response.
```
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
     Cache-Control: no-store
     Pragma: no-cache

     {
       "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
       "expires_in":3600,
       "scope":"buy"
     }
```
Note that if the backend elects to cache tokens, to serve future requests from the frontent without contacting the authorization server if still within the useful lifetime, it must also cache expiration information and scopes in accordance to the requirements expressed in this section.

## Errors {#ATError}

When the backend fails to deliver to the frontend the requeste token, it responds with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code and includes the following parameters with the response:

* `error` : An ASCII error code identifying the circumstances of the error. See the next sections for details. This parameter is REQUIRED.
* `error_description` : OPTIONAL. A human-readable message describing the error for troubleshooting purposes.

### No valid session found {#ATErrorInvalidSession}  

All requests to the backend MUST be performend in the context of a valid authenticated session, typically by presenting a session cookie over a TLS channel. If the backend cannot find or validate a session, it must reject the request and return a message as described in (#ATError), with an error parameter value of `invalid_session`.  

### Backend cannot perform a request to the authorization server {#ATErrorNoRT}

If the backend doesn't have the necessary artifacts (eg a refresh token for the current user and/or requested resource) to request a suitable access token to the authorization server without requiring user interaction, it will reject the request and return a message as described in (#ATError), with an error parameter value of `backend_not_ready`.  

### The backend request to the authorization server fails {#ATErrorFailedGrant}

If the backend request to the authorization server fails, the backend will return to the frontend a message as described in (#ATError), with as error parameter value the error parameter received in the authorization server response (as deescribed by section 5.2 of [@RFC6749] and, if present in the authorizations server response, will include the error_description parameter with the same parameter value as received by the authorization server. TODO wow this sentence is ugly.

# Requesting Session Information from the Backend {#requestingSessionInfo}

Application developers will often need to obtain information about the current session (such as user attributes, session expiration, etc) to display it to the end user, drive application behavior and any other operation it would perform if the frontend would be in charge of obtaining tokens directly. In the topology described in this specification, most of the user experience is driven by the frontent: however, the session information is inaccessible to the user agent, as it is either kept in artifacts that the user agent cannot inspect (opaque sessions cookies) or on the backend side. 
The .well-known/bff-sessioninfo endpoint is meant to restore the developer's ability to access the session information they need, without compromising the security of the solution. At any time, the frontend can leverage the current secure session to send to the `bff-sessioninfo` endpoint a request, and receive the required session information. The following sections provide details on request and response messages.

## Session Information Request

The frontent sends a request for session information via an HTTP GET, thru a TLS protected channel and in the context of a secure session. The request has no parameters.
The following is an example of session information request.
```
  GET /.well-known/bff-sessioninfo
  Host: myapp.example.com
```

## Session Information Response

If the request is executed in the context of a secure session and over TLS, the backend returns a JSON object containing any information it deems appropriate to share with the frontend about the content of the session.
For example, if the session was established via OpenID Connect OIDC TODO reference the response might contain the session and user attribute claims as defined in sections 2 and 5.1 of OIDC.
The following is a non-normative example of successful session information response.  
```
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
     Cache-Control: no-store
     Pragma: no-cache

     {
        "iss": "https://as.example.com",
   "sub": "24400320",
   "exp": 1311281970,
   "auth_time": 1311280969,
   "preferred_username": "johnny",
   "email_verified: "johnny@foo.com",
   "given_name": "Jonathan",
   "family_name" : "Swift"
     }
```
It is worth noting that the backend isn't bound to any specific rule and is free to return any information it deems necessary in this message in the context of the application (frontend and backend) own requirements. 
## Error
In case the frontend sends a request to bff-sessioninfo in thre absence of a valid secure session and/ot thru a TLS secure channel, the backend will return an error as described in (#ATErrorNoRT).
For any other error situation, the backend is free to determine what to signal to the frontend. TODO seems a bit weak... maybe a generic error?

# IANA Considerations {#IANA}
      
  TODO endpoitns registration, is it here? 
    

# Security Considerations {#Security}
      
The simplicity of the described pattern notwithstanding, there are a number of important considerations that frontent, backend and SDK implementers should keep in mind while implementing this approach.  

## Frontends should not cache access tokens in local storage

Part of the reason for which the pattern here described was devised is to help application developers to limit the attack surface of their code excuting in the user agent. Access tokens SHOULD NOT be saved in local storage: they SHOULD be kept in memory, and retrieved anew when necessary from the backend following (#requestingAT). 

## Mismatch between security characteristics of token requestor and API caller

Some authorization servers might express in their access tokens whether the client obtaining it authenticated itself, or it behaved as a public client. Resource servers might rely on that information to infer the nature and security characteristics of the application presenting the access token to them, and use that to drive authorization decisions (eg only applow certain operations if the caller is a confidential client). The pattern described here obtains an access token thru the backend, a confidential client, but the access token is ultimately used by code executing in a far less secure environment. Resource servers knowing that their clients will use this pattern SHOULD refrain from using the client authentication tupe as a factor in authorization decision, or, whenever possible, should use whatever extensions the authorization server of choice offers to signal that the requested access tokens will not be used by a confidential client.
As there are no standards to express in an access token the nature of the client authentication used in obtaining the token itself, this document does not provide a specific mechanism to influence the authorization server and leaves the task, in the rare cases it might be necessary, to individual implementations.

## Mismatch between scopes in a request vs cached tokens 

The backend will likely cache token responses from the authorization server, so that the backend can promptly serve equivalent requests from the frontend without further roundtrips toward the authorization server. That is a powerful optimization, but it presents scopes elevation risks if applied indiscriminately.
If the token cached by the authorization server features a superset of the scopes requested by the frontend, the backend SHOULD NOT return it to the frontend and perform a new request with the smaller scopes set to the authorization server.

## Resource server colocated with the backend

If the only API invoked by the frontent happens to be colocated with the backend, the frontend doesn't need to obtain access tokens to it: it can simply use the same secure session leveraged to protect requests to the token endpoints described here. The `bff-token` isn't necessary in that scenario, although `bff-sessioninfo` retains its usefulness to surface session and user information to the user agent code. Also note that the presence of the `bff-token` endpoint makes it possible to easily accommodate possible future evolutions where the frontend needs to invoke APIs protected by resource servers hosted elsewhere, without engendering changes in the security property of the application.


TODO Should we say something about: Requests could be more complicated than just scopes (think RAR) and the frotnend byght need to tell more than scopes to the backend. In that case, just add custom params and stir.
TODO We mentioed another thing, but I can't remember now.
